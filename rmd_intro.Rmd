## Intro to R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R Markdown documents are fully **reproducible**, they can be automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

### Installation

If you have not yet done so:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)
```

### Using R Code

There are two options when it comes to using R code in an Rmarkdown document:

- Code chunks

- Inline code

#### Code chunks

- Inserting a new code chunk:
    + keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
    + the Insert command in the editor toolbar (see other languages as well)

- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Chunk output can be customized with `knitr` options, arguments set in the {} of a chunk header.

Examples:

- `include = FALSE`: code runs and results be used by other chunks, but doesn't appear in finished file
- `echo = FALSE`:  prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file (useful way to embed figures)
- `message = FALSE`: messages do not appear in the finished file
- `warning = FALSE`: warnings do not appear in the finished file
- `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphical results

See [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for all options.

#### Inline code

Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a .Rmd file by enclosing the code with \` r\`

You can even use different languages (EX. Python) for this


### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Formatting Text

[R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

For emphasis:

*italics* and _italics_

**bold** and __bold__

Heading size:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4

Lists:

1. Ordered
2. Numeric 
3. List

* Unordered 
* Bulleted
* List

Links:

Insert links with a [] around the content you want to make a hyperlink followed by the url in ()

[This is an example link to my Github](https://github.com/SamanthaToet)

Images:

Similar to links, images are added by using an ! followed by the alt text in a [] followed by the path or url in ()

For example, here's a picture of some cookies off the internet:
